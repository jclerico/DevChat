    //Explanation for login func: Firstly we try to sign in. If there was an error, see what the error code is and if that code is userNotFound, then create a user. Once the user is created, we make sure that theres acutally a user ID (as a second verification), then we go ahead and sign in. After signing in, if theres an error show it otherwise we successfully logged in.
